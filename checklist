improvements to be made if want to be more resource intensive:
below improvement will be necessary for database setup, but much easier installation
is to just set a variable to the dollar value and update before betting

???
store balance on launch and update according to wins/losses => //*[@id="balance"]
track bet and potential gain
potential gain section => /html/body/div/div[4]/form/div[2]/div[2]/ul/li[2]/span/span[2]
watch betstatus for victor and update based on bet => //*[@id="betstatus"]
???

way down line track both fighters and update a database of some sort?
use stored info of fighters to calculate win/loss vs fighter and bet accordingly
